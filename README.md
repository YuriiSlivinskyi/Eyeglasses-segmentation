# Eyeglasses-segmentation
Image segmentation using U-Net architecture and TensorFlow
During this project I created data preprocessing pipelines, designed and trained Neural Network for eyeglasses segmentation.
NN consists of two parts:
- Encoder (used transfer learning from MobileNetV2)
- Decoder (designed by me) \
The model achieved ~95% IoU for test data.
